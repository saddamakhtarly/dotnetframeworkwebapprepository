GitHub Actions is an automation framework that can build, test, and deploy your app whenever a new commit is made in your repository. If your code is in GitHub, choose your repository here and we will add a workflow file to automatically deploy your app to App Service. If your code is not in GitHub, go to the Deployment Center once the web app is created to set up your deployment.
